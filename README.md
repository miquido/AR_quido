_Ahoy, me hearties! Set sail on the high seas of image recognition with our Flutter plugin. Arrr! ü¶ú_

# üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è ar_quido üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

Image recognition using Augmented Reality (AR) features for mobile Flutter apps.
It uses [EasyAR Sense](https://www.easyar.com/view/sdk.html) on Android and native
[ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/content_anchors/detecting_images_in_an_ar_experience)
on iOS.

The plugin has been built by Flutter Division at [Miquido Software development company](https://www.miquido.com).

## Getting started üö¢

Add the dependency in your `pubspec.yaml`:
- from command line: 
  ```bash
  flutter pub add ar_quido
  flutter pub get
  ```
- directly in pubspec.yaml:
  ```yaml
  dependencies:
     ar_quido: 0.1.1
  ```
### Android
Since the Android version depends on the EasyAR solution, you need to
[sign up](https://www.easyar.com/view/signUp.html) on their page and obtain 
an API key. After doing so, provide the key in Android Manifest file as 
`application`'s metadata:
```xml
<meta-data
           android:name="com.miquido.ar_quido.API_KEY"
           android:value="<YOUR_API_KEY>" />
```

### iOS
`ARKit` uses the device camera, so do not forget to provide the `NSCameraUsageDescription`
in Info.plist:
```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Describe why your app needs camera (AR) here.</string>
```

Also make sure, that your deployment target in project settings is set to 13.0.
Set the same version in `ios/Podfile`:
```ruby
platform :ios, '13.0'
```

## Usage üå¥
1. Put your reference images inside `assets/reference_images` directory (make 
sure to reference them in `pubspec.yaml`).
    - please note, that only `.jpg` images are supported at this time
2. Place `ARQuidoView` widget in your view's code. Provide at least an array of
image names you want to detect (through `referenceImageNames` property) and a 
callback for detected images (through `onImageDetected` property):
   ```dart
    ARQuidoView(
      referenceImageNames: const ['applandroid'],
      onImageDetected: (imageName) {
        // handle detected image
      },
    ),
   ```
3. That's it, you're all set ‚öì

Please see the [example](https://github.com/miquido/AR_quido/tree/main/example)
for more info. You can also check the details in [API Documentation](https://pub.dev/documentation/ar_quido/latest/),
but please note, that it's still work in progress.
